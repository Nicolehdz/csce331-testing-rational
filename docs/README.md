# Activity: Rational Numbers

We will write the class `Rational` which represents a rational number and supports arithmetic and comparison operations on Rationals. A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction <sup>*a*</sup>/<sub>*b*</sub> of two integers, a numerator *a* and a non-zero denominator *b*.  For example, <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. is a rational number, as is every integer (e.g. 7 = <sup>7</sup>/<sub>1</sub>).

Before we write any code, we must think.  We must think about

* What data (attributes) need to be stored?
* What operations (methods) need to be supported?
* What are the expected behaviors of the methods?
* How will we know that our methods are complete and correct?
* How will we know that our class is complete and correct?

We should also think about

* How do the attributes relate to each other?
* What attributes do the methods need to access?
* How do the methods relate to each other?

So, let's think about it.

What does the class need to do?

It needs to represent a rational number and it needs to provide arithmetic and comparison operations.
