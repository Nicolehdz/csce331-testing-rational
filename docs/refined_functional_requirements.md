For each operation in the list on the previous page, identify the inputs (how many, what do they represent, what are their datatypes), the output and/or side effects (return type and changes to the object(s), if any), and what should happen in the case of invalid input.

Again, sometimes, the necessary inputs, outputs, and error conditions are known ahead of time and are provided as part of the specification or, sometimes, we can take our interface design and validate it with someone who has authority over the project specifications.
