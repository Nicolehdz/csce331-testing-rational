# Functional Requirements
[back to README](README.md)

<br/>

Think for yourself about what the `Rational` class must do.  Make a list of at least 5 operations that you think a complete `Rational` class would provide.

<details>
  <summary>Expand to see my thoughts.</summary>

1. Construct a new `Rational`
1. Add `Rational`s
1. Subtract `Rational`s
1. Multiply `Rational`s
1. Divide `Rational`s
1. Compare `Rational`s for
   1. equality
   1. greater than
   1. less than
1. Pretty-print a `Rational`
</details>

Sometimes, the necessary operations are known ahead of time and are provided as part of the specification.  Sometimes, we can take our list and validate it with someone who has authority over the project specifications, e.g. the product owner or the client.
