# Submission
[back to the rest of the f*ing tests](the_rest_of_the_fing_tests.md)

Submit the following files to Gradescope:

* `src/main/java/numbers/Rational.java`
* `src/test/java/numbers/RationalTest.java`

**Note**:
* The directory structure is **mandatory**.  You must have the `src/` directory, within which are the `main/` and `test/` directories, and so on.
* You do **not** need to submit `pom.xml`.
* You can [download/copy the provided `pom.xml` file for this activity](https://github.com/tamu-edu-students/csce331-testing-rational/blob/main/pom.xml) on GitHub.
* Auto-generated tests are unacceptable.  This includes AI tools like ChatGPT, test-generation tools, and even test-generation code that you write yourself (although... do come see me about a 491 if you're interested in exploring automated test generation). The point of this activity is to learn how to **write tests yourself**.
  + submissions that seem to have auto-generated tests will recieve a score of 0.
* To complete this assignment, you must earn a score of at least 70 points from the autograder.

## Creating the Zip File for Submission

You can create the zip file for submission like so:

```bash
zip submission.zip src/main/java/numbers/Rational.java src/test/java/numbers/RationalTest.java
```
