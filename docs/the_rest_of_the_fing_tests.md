# By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do

Follow [the Test-Driven Development process](tdd_process.md) for each remaining functional requirement.

You should also consider whether your current tests adequately cover the required functionality.  If you see some functionality, or some case, which is not covered, you should create tests that verify correctness for those cases.

[Refer to the complete specification.](client_complete_specification.md)

## Testing and Debugging

You will probably make errors when coding.  If you discover the error in the moment at which you created it, you should fix it immediately.  If you do not spot the error until after some unexpected behavior is observed (e.g. a bug is reported), you should adhere to the TDD process and capture the correct expected behavior in a test that reproduces the error *before* attempting to fix it in the code.
